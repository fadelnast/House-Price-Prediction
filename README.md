# Predicting House Price

We create a machine learning model to predict the house price using Random Forest.

## Dataset

Training and Testing Dataset that we were uses are sourced from kaggle datasets : https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data 

The training dataset consist of list of house prices with several features, like number of bed room, number of bath room, the total area, etc.


## Model

For this model, we use Random Forest, and only using features that might have correlation with house price by eliminating some features.

## Prerequisites

There is no need to install anything because it is basically written in kaggle notebook with cloud service.

* Copy this repository link to your google colab https://github.com/fadelnast/House-Price-Prediction/blob/master/House%20Prices.ipynb 
* After successfully open the notebook, you can get the datasets in here https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data?select=data_description.txt
